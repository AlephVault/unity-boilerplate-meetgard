# A Meetgard boilerplate for Unity
This is a boilerplate project. It includes Meetgard and all the required dependencies, and will be tagged with local or specific versions of those dependency packages.

Unity version
-------------

The current status is meant to be used in Unity 2023.2.8f1 or better. The upper version is not yet determined, and lower versions are not supported (i.e. it may work, but with no responsibilities from the development side).

Dependencies versioning and status
----------------------------------

So far this project relies on a set of packages that I could consider, at best, in beta status. These packages are not officially released and they are tagged 0.0.1. The referenced packages exist into this organization and must be cloned individually besides this boilerplate (i.e. as a sibling directory). They are:

 - com.alephvault.unity.support: [Clone it - 0.0.3](https://github.com/AlephVault/unity-support/tree/0.0.3).
 - com.alephvault.unity.support.generic: [Clone it - 0.0.1](https://github.com/AlephVault/unity-support-generic/tree/0.0.1).
 - com.alephvault.unity.boilerplates: [Clone it - 0.0.2](https://github.com/AlephVault/unity-boilerplates/tree/0.0.2).
 - com.alephvault.unity.binary: [Clone it - 0.0.2](https://github.com/AlephVault/unity-binary/tree/0.0.2).
 - com.alephvault.unity.layout: [Clone it - 0.0.1](https://github.com/AlephVault/unity-layout/tree/0.0.1).
 - com.alephvault.unity.menuactions: [Clone it - 0.0.2](https://github.com/AlephVault/unity-menu-actions/tree/0.0.2).
 - com.alephvault.unity.meetgard: [Clone it - 0.0.6](https://github.com/AlephVault/unity-meetgard/tree/0.0.6).
 - com.alephvault.unity.meetgard.auth: [Clone it - 0.0.5](https://github.com/AlephVault/unity-meetgard-auth/tree/0.0.5).
 - com.alephvault.unity.meetgard.scopes: [Clone it - 0.0.3](https://github.com/AlephVault/unity-meetgard-scopes/tree/0.0.3).
 - com.alephvault.unity.remotestorage: [Clone it - 0.0.2](https://github.com/AlephVault/unity-remotestorage/tree/0.0.2).

You can run the attached scripts to clone the dependencies after cloning this project:

 - Windows: clone-all.bat
 - Unix-based (bash): clone-all.sh
 
If you have these repositories already cloned for another boilerplate and version, you can just go inside and checkout the proper (remote, typically) tags instead.
